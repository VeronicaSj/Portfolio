For large, projects, I \n                think the benefits clearly outweigh the drawbacks: \n                better design, fewer bugs, and more confidence when \n                working with the code. But for small projects, rapid \n                prototypes, or experiments, it can be an excess of \n                rigor that slows things down more than it helps.\n            </p>\n            <p className={styles.parag}>\n                In my case, I still apply the classical code-test \n                development and sometimes I dare to reverse the order.\n                My recommendation is: Practice testing code that you\n                already know works. Once you know you can trust your \n                tests, Test-Driven Development can be your best \n                friend on medium and large projects.\n            </p>\n        </div>\n    );\n}\n\nexport default Post1content;"],"mappings":";AAAA,OAAOA,YAAY,MAAM,4CAA4C;AACrE,OAAOC,MAAM,MAAM,2BAA2B;AAAC,SAAAC,MAAA,IAAAC,OAAA;AAE/C,SAASC,YAAYA,CAAA,EAAG;EAEpB,oBACID,OAAA;IAAKE,EAAE,EAAC,cAAc;IAClBC,KAAK,EAAE;MAACC,KAAK,EAAC,MAAM;MAAGC,OAAO,EAAC,MAAM;MAAEC,aAAa,EAAC,QAAQ;MAAEC,UAAU,EAAC;IAAQ,CAAG;IAAAC,QAAA,gBACrFR,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAK5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAIS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACiB,IAAK;MAAAP,QAAA,gBACvBR,OAAA;QAAAQ,QAAA,GAAI,eACa,eAAAR,OAAA;UAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACkB,SAAU;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAe;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAChE,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;QAAAQ,QAAA,GAAI,sBACoB,eAAAR,OAAA;UAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACkB,SAAU;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAK;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,2BACjE;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;QAAAQ,QAAA,GAAI,wBACsB,eAAAR,OAAA;UAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACkB,SAAU;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAI;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,+BAClE;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;QAAAQ,QAAA,eACIR,OAAA;UAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACkB,SAAU;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAQ;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG;MAAC;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAC5C,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;QAAAQ,QAAA,gBACIR,OAAA;UAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACkB,SAAU;UAAAR,QAAA,EAAC;QAAM;UAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;UAAAC,UAAA;UAAAC,YAAA;QAAA,OAAG,CAAC,0CAC9C;MAAA;QAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;QAAAC,UAAA;QAAAC,YAAA;MAAA,OAAI,CAAC;IAAA;MAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OACL,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAM5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eAEJd,OAAA,CAACH,YAAY;MACToB,aAAa,EAAC,0BAA0B;MACxCC,QAAQ,EAAE,CACN;QAACC,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;QACnCC,IAAI,EAAE,0CAA0C,GAC5C,0CAA0C,GAC1C,6CAA6C,GAC7C;MAA8C,CAAC,EACvD;QAACD,KAAK,EAAE,+BAA+B;QACnCC,IAAI,EAAE,+CAA+C,GACjD,2CAA2C,GAC3C,6CAA6C,GAC7C;MAAiB,CAAC,EAC1B;QAACD,KAAK,EAAE,0BAA0B;QAC9BC,IAAI,EAAE,6CAA6C,GAC/C,2CAA2C,GAC3C,0CAA0C,GAC1C;MAAwC,CAAC,CAC/C;MACNC,aAAa,EAAC,iCAAiC;MAC/CC,QAAQ,EAAE,CACN;QAACH,KAAK,EAAE,gBAAgB;QACpBC,IAAI,EAAE,oDAAoD,GAC1D;MAAqF,CAAC,EAC1F;QAACD,KAAK,EAAE,kBAAkB;QACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,4CAA4C,GAC9C,0CAA0C,GAC1C,+CAA+C,GAC/C,2CAA2C,GAC3C;MAAY,CAAC,EACrB;QAACD,KAAK,EAAE,kBAAkB;QACtBC,IAAI,EAAE,+CAA+C,GACjD,gDAAgD,GAChD;MAAyB,CAAC,EAClC;QAACD,KAAK,EAAE,yBAAyB;QAC7BC,IAAI,EAAE,+CAA+C,GACjD,6CAA6C,GAC7C,6CAA6C,GAC7C;MAA6C,CAAC;IACxD;MAAAT,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAe,CAAC,eAEtBd,OAAA;MAAAQ,QAAA,EAAI;IAEJ;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAK5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAK5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAM5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAM5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAAQ,QAAA,EAAI;IAEJ;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAI,CAAC,eACLd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAO5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC,eACJd,OAAA;MAAGS,SAAS,EAAEX,MAAM,CAACY,KAAM;MAAAF,QAAA,EAAC;IAO5B;MAAAG,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;MAAAC,UAAA;MAAAC,YAAA;IAAA,OAAG,CAAC;EAAA;IAAAH,QAAA,EAAAC,YAAA;IAAAC,UAAA;IAAAC,YAAA;EAAA,OACH,CAAC;AAEd;AAACS,EAAA,GA/HQtB,YAAY;AAiIrB,eAAeA,YAAY;AAAC,IAAAsB,EAAA;AAAAC,YAAA,CAAAD,EAAA","ignoreList":[]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module","externalDependencies":[]}
